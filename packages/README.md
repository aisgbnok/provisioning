# Packages

Here you will find all the packages' ICD configuration files and assets.
You can find more about each package by navigating to its directory and reading its readme.

To build individual packages, run the corresponding ICD command found in [`building.md`](building.md).
You must execute all commands or scripts at the root of this directory.
For more information, see [Building Packages](../README.md#building-packages).
