# Packages

Here you will find all the packages' ICD configuration files and assets. You can find more about
each package by navigating to its directory and reading its readme.

For building individual packages run the corresponding ICD command in
the [`commands.md`](commands.md)
file. [More details on building packages can be found at the main readme.](https://github.com/aisgbnok/provisioning#building--installing-provisioning-packages)
