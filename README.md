# Welcome to Provisioning

This repository contains the configuration files for compiling personal windows provisioning
packages. These packages are largely for personal usage, but may be beneficial to others. I had a

track... 🚧

> To reduce redundancy and make it easier for me and everyone else, it is assumed that you have a general understanding of Windows Provisioning Packages. Don't be afraid to ask for help or open an issue, but please have a basic understanding of provisioning packages first. Thanks!

## Provisioning Alignment

_Provisioning Alignment_ is the name given to the currently underway repository, codebase, and
package cleanup. The goal:

- [ ] Align the packages' version numbers
  etc. [Issue.](https://github.com/aisgbnok/provisioning/issues/3) [Pull Request.](https://github.com/aisgbnok/provisioning/pull/2)
- [ ] Provide improved repository documentation and roadmaps, like this. 😁
- [ ] Include more detailed software descriptions. (What software does each package includes? What
  version?)
- [ ] Hopefully add helpful custom automation. (GitHub Actions 🚀)

_[Here is the link to the GitHub project for _Provisioning
Alignment_.](https://github.com/aisgbnok/provisioning/projects/2) You can also access it by
