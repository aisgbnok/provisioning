# Welcome to Provisioning

This repository holds the configuration files for compiling the personal windows provisioning
packages I have created over the past year. These packages are for personal usage; however, they may
be beneficial to others looking for examples, references, or more extensive documentation. The
Microsoft provisioning documentation supplied a basis for understanding windows provisioning, but
there was much more to discover that was not implicitly documented.

I started this journey a year ago, and throughout the past year, I have had many questions,
completed lots of experiments, and have more to understand. This repository acts as a living space
for the continuation and maintenance of this journey.


> To reduce redundancy and make it easier for everyone, it is assumed that you have a general understanding of Windows Provisioning Packages. Do not be afraid to ask for help or open an issue, but please have a basic understanding of provisioning packages first. Thanks!

## Provisioning Alignment

_Provisioning Alignment_ is the name given to the currently underway repository, codebase, and
package cleanup. The goal:

- [ ] Align the packages' version numbers
  etc. [Issue.](https://github.com/aisgbnok/provisioning/issues/3) [Pull Request.](https://github.com/aisgbnok/provisioning/pull/2)
- [ ] Provide improved repository documentation and roadmaps, like this. 😁
- [ ] Include more detailed software descriptions. (What software does each package includes? What
  version?)
- [ ] Hopefully add helpful custom automation. (GitHub Actions 🚀)

_[Here is the link to the GitHub project for _Provisioning
Alignment_.](https://github.com/aisgbnok/provisioning/projects/2) You can also access it by
navigating to the **Projects** tab in GitHub._

## Provisioning 4.0

The plan for delivering Provisioning 4.0 is in progress and will be updated as the project continues
to develop. The goal is to finish _Provisioning Alignment_ which will largely clean up this repo,
then work can begin on v4. The goal of v4 is largely an extension of _Provisioning Alignment_,
however with a clearer mission to improve the packages themselves.

_Provisioning Alignment_'s goal is to clean up and add documentation for what is already present.
v4's goal is to rewrite the packages for efficiency and introduce possibly breaking changes to
improve long-term maintainability.
