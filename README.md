# Welcome to Provisioning

This repository contains the configuration files for compiling personal windows provisioning

track... 🚧

## Provisioning Alignment

_Provisioning Alignment_ is the name given to the currently underway repository, codebase, and
package cleanup. The goal:

- Align the packages' version numbers, structure, etc.
- Provide improved repository documentation and roadmaps, like this. 😁
- Include more detailed software descriptions. (What software does each package includes? What
  version?)
- Hopefully add helpful custom automation. (GitHub Actions 🚀)
