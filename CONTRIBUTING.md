# Provisioning Contributor Guide

Below is guidance for how to report issues and submit contributions via Pull Requests (PRs).

## Issues

It's best to start with filing an issue before beginning work on something.
This is generally how I work, and it helps with brainstorming and thinking through an issue or feature all the way until it's finished and merged.
Issues should be used for reporting bugs, providing recommendations, requesting new features, or pretty much anything.

## Contributing (PRs)

If you want to work on an issue that is unassigned or has a "Help Wanted" tag, feel free to ask to be assigned to that issue.
Create a draft Pull Request and feel free to request review whenever. However, please test changes to ensure they seem to work as expected before requesting review.

## Thank You

Thank you in advance for your contribution!
