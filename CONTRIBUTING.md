# Provisioning Contributor Guide

Below is guidance for how to report issues and submit contributions via pull requests (PRs).
This repository is generally for personal usage, but feel free to aks questions, open issues, or contribute.

## Issues

If you find in issue with documentation, a package, or take issue with anything in this repository please open an issue.
Additionally, before beginning work on a contribution, open an issue.
This is generally how I work, and it helps with brainstorming and thinking through an issue or feature as well as allowing community engagement and feedback during development.
Issues should be used for reporting bugs, providing recommendations, requesting new features, or pretty much anything.

## Contributing (PRs)

As mentioned above, make sure to open an issue before begging work on a contribution.
If you want to work on an issue that is unassigned or has a "Help Wanted" tag, ask to be assigned to that issue.
After being assigned to that issue, start development in a separate branch and create a draft pull request during development.
A pull request template is automatically provided, make sure to read and use the template.
Feel free to request review when you are ready; however, test changes to ensure they work as expected before requesting review.

## Thank You

Thank you in advance for your contribution!
