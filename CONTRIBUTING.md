# Provisioning Contributor Guide

Below is guidance for how to report issues and submit contributions via Pull Requests (PRs).

Here is a link to the community [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Issues

It's best to start with filing an issue before beginning work on something. Issues should be used
for reporting issues, providing recommendations, or requesting new features or changes.

> Issue Templates will be added soon.

### Contributing (PRs)

Feel free to work on something if an issue is open with a help-wanted tag, or you authored the
issue.

Create a draft Pull Request and feel free to request review whenever. However, please test changes
to ensure they seem to work as expected before submitting a PR.

> PR Templates will be added soon.

### Thank You

Thank you for your contribution!
